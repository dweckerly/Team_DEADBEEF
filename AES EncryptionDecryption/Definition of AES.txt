AES (acronym of Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric encryption algorithm.
The algorithm was developed by two Belgian cryptographer Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen.
AES was designed to be efficient in both hardware and software, and supports a block length of 128 bits and key lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits.
