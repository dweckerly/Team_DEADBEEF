So i was looking into possible path finding algorithms and this is what I came up with.

this function could be a possible way to calculate the distance between the character and an enemy.

function Distance(AINode A, AINode B)
{
    dx = abs(A.x - B.x)
    dy = abs(A.y - B.y)
    return (dx + dy);
}

I have been looking into A* for possible path finding algorithms and looking to see if anyone else has looked into the matter.


This is some links to some interesting concepts about A* pathfinding and possible uses for it
